# meetUp

This project will contain alot of componenets and look into the concept of routing

What is routing?
This is when a page loaded by a browser never changes. The user is given the illusion of going on different pages, but really they are always on the same page and no request is made to a server.
Tool used to do the routing - 'react-router-dom'
Command used to fix 'react-router-dom' issue:
npm install @types/react @types/react-dom @types/react-router-dom --save-dev

The job of Route, which is imported in App.js is to define different paths in th eURL we want to listen to and which componenet should be loaded for the different paths

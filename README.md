# meetUp

This project will contain alot of componenets and look into the concept of routing

What is routing?
This is when a page loaded by a browser never changes. The user is given the illusion of going on different pages, but really they are always on the same page and no request is made to a server.
Tool used to do the routing - 'react-router-dom'
